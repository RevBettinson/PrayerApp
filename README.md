# PrayerApp
An attempt at a prayer app, initially aimed at the Church In Wales

This app is an attempt to bring the Church In Wales Daily Offices to a mobile device. 

It is currently available from the Android Play Store. 

It can:

Offer Morning and Evening prayer in both English and Welsh
Includes inline bible readings from the Church In Wales lectionary

Version 1.2.2 is mostly stable, but continues to be a work in progress while the lectionary is updated to be more future proof. 
=======
It can currently:

1. Offer a Morning Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
2. Offer an Evening Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
3. Uses the Church-In-Wales lectionary
4. Will get the English Bible readings, and place them in-line in your prayer of choice (Welsh Bible readings are under investigation)
