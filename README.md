# PrayerApp
An attempt at a prayer app, initially aimed at the Church In Wales

This app is an attempt to bring the Church In Wales Daily Offices to a mobile device. 

It can currently:

1. Offer a Morning Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
2. Offer an Evening Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
3. Uses the Church-In-Wales lectionary
