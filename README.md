# PrayerApp
An attempt at a prayer app, initially aimed at the Church In Wales

This app is an attempt to bring the Church In Wales Daily Offices to a mobile device. 

It can currently:

1. Offer a Morning Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
2. Offer an Evening Prayer (including a cycle of readings) in both English and Welsh.
3. Uses the Church-In-Wales lectionary
4. Will get the English Bible readings, and place them in-line in your prayer of choice (Welsh Bible readings are under investigation)

Your device may warn you about installation from "uknown sources", click "Okay". Make sure that you only do it for this app, and not for everything, if that's an option. 
Your device may warn you about "Unknown" or "Untrusted" publisher. Click "Okay" or "Install Anway" (depending on the phone). 

You should find the app called "Prayer" is now installed. You should find the icon to be a slightly off-center Church Of Wales round cross
