<h1>Welcome to the <em>(Unofficial)</em> Church In Wales App</h1>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<P>Welcome to the first release of the (Unofficail) Church in Wales Prayer app.
For a long time people have complained that we don't have one that uses our liturgy, and misses
out on a wealth of our own tradition. This is my attempt at producing one.
</p>
<P>
The first thing to say is that this app is not complete (as you can see below). It is a work in
progress. There may be niggles, and places where it doesn't quite work as you might expect. These are
called 'bugs'. If you find a bug, please let me know!
</P>
<p>
You might also find that while using the app, there's something that you expect it to do, that it
doesn't. This is called a "Feature", or rather, the lack of a feature. If you notice something that
you miss from another app that you are using, please let me know, by making a "Feature Request".
</p>
<p>
This app is developed (currently) in my own time, and done as a labour of love. If you like what
I'm doing, and would like to help, or perhaps even support this form of ministry, please
consider donating to my Koffi (https://ko-fi.com/philbettinson).</p>
<p>
</P>
This app is currently under heavy development. Please always check for the latest version before
