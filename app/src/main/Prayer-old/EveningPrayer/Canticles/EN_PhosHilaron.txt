<h2>Phos Hilaron</h2>
<br>
O gracious light,<br>
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven:<br>
O Jesus Christ holy and blessed!<br>
Now, as we come to the setting of the sun:<br>
and our eyes behold the evening light,<br>
We sing your praises, O God:<br>
Father Son and Holy Spirit.<br>
You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices<br>
