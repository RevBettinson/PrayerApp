<h2>The Lord's Prayer</h2>
<br>
Let us pray with confidence to the Father:<br>
<br><strong>
Our Father in heaven,<br>
hallowed be your name,<br>
your kingdom come,<br>
your will be done,<br>
on earth as in heaven.<br>
Give us today our daily bread.<br>
Forgive us our sins<br>
as we forgive those who sin against us.<br>
Save us from the time of trial<br>
and deliver us from evil.<br>
For the kingdom, the power,<br>
and the glory are yours<br>
now and for ever.<br>
Amen.<br>
</strong><br>
