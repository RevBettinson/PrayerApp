<h2>The Conclusion</h2>

To God the Father, who first loved us,
and made us accepted in the Beloved;
to God the Son, who loved us,
and washed us from our sins by his own blood;
to God the Holy Spirit,
who sheds the love of God abroad in our hearts;
to the one true God
be all love and all glory,
for time and for eternity. <strong>Amen.</strong>

The Lord be with you.<br>
<strong>And also with you.</strong><br>

<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
