<h2>The Conclusion</h2>
<br>
Now to him who can keep us from falling and set us in
the presence of his glory, jubilant and above reproach, to
the only God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, power and
authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all time,
now and for ever. <strong>Amen</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Lord be with you.<br>
<strong>And also with you.</strong><br>
<br>
Let us bless the Lord.<br>
<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
