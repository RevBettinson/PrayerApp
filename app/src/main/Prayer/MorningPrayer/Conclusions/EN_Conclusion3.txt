<h2>The Conclusion</h2>
<br>
Now to him who is able through the power which is at 
work among us to do immeasurably more than we can ask 
or conceive, to him be glory in the church and in Christ 
Jesus from generation to generation for ever. <strong>Amen.</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Lord be with you.<br>
<strong>And also with you.</strong><br>
<br>
Let us bless the Lord.<br>
<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
