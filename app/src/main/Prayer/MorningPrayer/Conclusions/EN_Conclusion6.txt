<h2>The Conclusion</h2>
<br>
To him who loves us and has set us free from our sins
with his blood, who has made us a royal house, to serve
as the priests of his God and Father: to him be glory and
dominion for ever. <strong>Amen</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Lord be with you.<br>
<strong>And also with you.</strong><br>
<br>
Let us bless the Lord.<br>
<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong>
