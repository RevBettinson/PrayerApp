<h2>The third collect, for grace.</h2>
<br>
Eternal God and Father,<br>
by your power we are created<br>
and by your love we are redeemed:<br>
guide and strengthen us by your Spirit,<br>
that we may give ourselves to you<br>
in love and service of one another;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong><br>
