<h2>The second collect, for peace.</h2>
<br>
Eternal God, source of all holy desires,<br>
all good counsels and all just works:<br>
give your servants that peace which the world cannot give,<br>
that we may willingly obey your commandments,<br>
and that, free from the fear of our enemies,<br>
we may pass our time in rest and quietness;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong><br>
