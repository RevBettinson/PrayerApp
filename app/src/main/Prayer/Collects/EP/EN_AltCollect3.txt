<h2>The third collect.</h2>
<br>
Creator of the universe, watch over us<br>
and keep us in the light of your presence.<br>
Let our praise continually blend with that of all creation,<br>
and bring us, with all for whom we pray,<br>
to the eternal joys which you promise in your love;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Saviour. <strong>Amen.</strong><br>
