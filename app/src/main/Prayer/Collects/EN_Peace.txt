<h2>The second collect, for peace.</h2>
<br>
O God, the author of peace and lover of concord,<br>
to know you is eternal life,<br>
to serve you is perfect freedom:<br>
defend us in all assaults of our enemies,<br>
that we, surely trusting in your protection,<br>
may not fear the power of any adversaries;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. <strong>Amen.</strong><br>
