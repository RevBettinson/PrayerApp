<h2>The third collect, for grace.</h2>
<br>
O Lord and heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God,<br>
we thank you for bringing us safely<br>
to the beginning of this new day:<br>
defend us by your mighty power<br>
that we may be kept free from all sin<Br>
and safe from every danger;<br>
and enable us in everything<br>
to do only what is right in your eyes;<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.<br>
<br>
