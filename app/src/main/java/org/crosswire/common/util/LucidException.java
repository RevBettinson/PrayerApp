/**
 * A LucidException adds 2 concepts to a base Exception, that of a wrapped
 * Exception, that of internationalized (i18n) messages.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The first addition is the concept of an optional wrapped Exception (actually
 * a Throwable), which describes what caused this to happen. Any well defined
 * interface will define the exact exceptions that the methods of that interface
 * will throw, and not leave it to the ambiguous "throws Exception". However the
 * interface should have no idea how it will be implemented and so the details
 * of exactly what broke under the covers gets lost. With LucidException this
 * detail is kept in the wrapped Exception. This functionality has been added to
 * the base Exception class in J2SE 1.4
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The second addition is the concept of i18n messages. Normal Exceptions are
 * created with an almost random string in the message field, LucidExceptions
 * define this string to be a key into a resource bundle, and to help formatting
 * this string there is an optional Object array of format options. There is a
 * constructor that allows us to specify no i18n lookup, which is useful if this
 * lookup may have been done already.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @see gnu.lgpl.License The GNU Lesser General Public License for details.
