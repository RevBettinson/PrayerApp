         * t.length()+1, we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length
         * s.length()+1. The first, d, is the 'current working' distance array
         * that maintains the newest distance cost counts as we iterate through
         * the characters of String s. Each time we increment the index of
         * String t we are comparing, d is copied to p, the second int[]. Doing
         * so allows us to retain the previous cost counts as required by the
         * algorithm (taking the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one,
         * and diagonally up and to the left of the current cost count being
         * calculated). (Note that the arrays aren't really copied anymore, just
         * switched...this is clearly much better than cloning an array or doing
         * a System.arraycopy() each time through the outer loop.)
         * 
         * Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is this
         * one does not cause an out of memory condition when calculating the LD
         * over two very large strings.
